By assigning pairs of truth values to ground edges, this framework captures the uncertainty and contradictions stemming from incomplete or conflicting information. We explore the semantics of these graphs and provide a practical example to illustrate the proposed approach.",

pages="243--264",
abstract="This work is devoted to formal reasoning on relational properties of probabilistic imperative programs. Relational properties are properties which relate the execution of two programs (possibly the same one) on two initial memories. We aim at extending the algebraic approach of Kleene Algebras with Tests (KAT) to relational properties of probabilistic programs. For that we consider the approach of Guarded Kleene Algebras with Tests (GKAT), which can be used for representing probabilistic programs, and define a relational version of it, called Bi-guarded Kleene Algebras with Tests (BiGKAT) together with a semantics. We show that the setting of BiGKAT is expressive enough to encode a finitary version of probabilistic Relational Hoare Logic (pRHL) (without the While rule), a program logic that has been introduced in the literature for the verification of relational properties of probabilistic programs. We also discuss the additional expressivity brought by BiGKAT.",
