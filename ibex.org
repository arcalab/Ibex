#+TITLE: Ibex - Quantitative methods for cyber-physical programming
-----
* Project's description

Thanks to advances in computational power and miniaturisation,
software is increasingly embedded in infrastructures and industrial
processes in order to boost efficiency, safety, and production. In
this context it is now qualified as *cyber-physical* to emphasise its
usual tight interaction with physical processes (such as velocity,
movement, and temperature), and to sign a shift from usual software
engineering practices to a more multifaceted view that combines
computer science, control theory, and analysis. Actually, there has
been important progress in the development of mathematical foundations
for cyber-physical systems. Existing results typically take the form
of a *hybrid process algebra*, intuitively adding the notion of a
differential equation to an existing, well-established process
algebra.

The fact that computational processes are intermixed with physical
ones raises challenging aspects that severely hinder these results as
foundations for an engineering discipline of cyber-physical
software. Specifically, the latter brings an inherent layer of
*uncertainty*, due to noise in sensors and actuators.
Moreover, it
requires notions of *behavioural distance* for realistically comparing
two systems in a algebraic, rigorous way.  The goal of this project is
thus to develop the mathematical foundations of cyber-physical
programming by taking into account the quantitative aspects discussed
above: uncertainty and behavioural distance. Note that our goal is
*not* develop a specific programming language for cyber-physical
systems, but rather to focus on core, semantic foundations and calculi
which will then serve as basis for developing such languages.
