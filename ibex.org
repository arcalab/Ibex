[[file:Spanish_Ibex_Portrait.jpg]] Thanks to advances in computational
power and miniaturisation, software is increasingly embedded in
infrastructures and industrial processes in order to boost efficiency,
safety, and production. In this context it is now qualified as
*cyber-physical* to emphasise its usual tight interaction with
physical processes (such as velocity, movement, and temperature), and
to sign a shift from usual software engineering practices to a more
multifaceted view that combines computer science, control theory, and
analysis. Actually, there has been important progress in the
development of mathematical foundations for cyber-physical systems. Existing results typically take the form of a *hybrid
process algebra*, intuitively adding the notion of a differential
equation to an existing, well-established process algebra. However,
the fact that computational processes are intermixed with physical
ones raises challenging aspects that severely hinder these results as
foundations for an engineering discipline of cyber-physical
software. Specifically, the latter brings an inherent layer of
*uncertainty*, due to noise in sensors and actuators. Moreover, it
requires notions of *behavioural distance* for realistically comparing
two systems in a algebraic, rigorous way.  The goal of this project is
therefore to develop the mathematical foundations of cyber-physical
programming by taking into account the quantitative aspects discussed
above: uncertainty and behavioural distance. Note that our goal is
*not* develop a specific programming language for cyber-physical
systems, but rather to focus on core, semantic foundations and calculi
which will then serve as basis for developing such languages.
