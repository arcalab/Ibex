                        <p>
                                Thanks to advances in computational power and
                                miniaturisation, software is increasingly
                                embedded in physical infrastructures and
                                industrial processes, in order to boost efficiency,
                                safety, and production. In this context it is
                                now qualified as cyber-physical to emphasise
                                its tight interaction with physical processes
                                - thus signaling a shift from usual software
                                engineering practices to a more multifaceted
                                view that combines computer science, control
                                theory, and analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                There has been tremendous progress in the
                                development of mathematical foundations for
                                cyber-physical systems. However the fact that
                                the latter intertwine computational processes
                                with physical ones raises challenging aspects
                                that hinder such results as foundations of a
                                cyber-physical engineering discipline. 
                        </p>       
                        <p>
                                A core issue is the difficulty in dealing with
                                environmental variability, caused by external
                                sources of uncertainty, as well as noisy
                                sensors and actuators. At the root of this
                                difficulty is the fact that many of the
                                principles involved are based on a classical,
                                qualitative perspective whilst the underlying
                                interactions with physical processes typically
                                demand approaches of a more quantitative
                                nature.  The latter include for example statistical
                                reasoning, relaxed notions of bisimilarity and
                                program equivalence, robustness measures, and
                                quantitative logics.

                        <p>
                                The workshop aims at calling attention to
                                and discussing the quantitative principles of
                                cyber-physical systems.

                                        is the field that evaluates medical
                                        technologies such as new drugs with the
                                        perspective of enabling their use. This
                                        process is done by modeling the
                                        scenarios with and without the drug and
                                        computing the possible outcomes of the
                                        introduction of a health technology at
                                        a particular national health system.
                                        This is done by considering structures
                                        composed of "Health states" which
                                        represent the dynamic evolution of a
                                        patient. Probabilistic state-transition
                                        models are used to model and study the
                                        impact of the technology, taking into
                                        account not only the efficacy but also
                                        budget costs. In this work we make use
                                        of PRISM - a symbolic probabilistic
                                        model checker - to approach a problem
                                        in this field. Moreover, we compare it
                                        with the methods currently used in
                                        order to show how formal tools can be
                                        applied and useful for purposes of HTA
                                        evaluations.

                                                        incomplete information.

                                                        through two
                                                        accessibility relations
                                                        that weigh the evidence
                                                        of a transition
                                                        occurring or not. These
                                                        weights come,
                                                        parametrically, from a

                                                        when their sum equals
                                                        the unit; vagueness,
                                                        when the sum is less
                                                        than the unit; and
                                                        inconsistency, when the

                                                        This talk will explore

                                                        about them.
                                                        Additionally, we introduce two notions of
                                                        simulation and

                                                        Finally, results of

                                                        systems, i.e., systems
                                                        that mix discrete
                                                        processes - such as
                                                        deterministic programs
                                                        - with continuous (and
                                                        physical) behaviour -
                                                        such as movement,
                                           velocity, and voltage - is
                                           difficult. Our approach to design
                                           and analyse such systems is to
                                           animate a basic calculus, using a
                                           c-like syntax, which includes
                                           statements where variables evolve
                                           based on systems of ordinary
                                           differential equations (ODEs). Our
                                           proof-of-concept tool is called
                                           Lince, which does not need to be
                                           installed, requiring only a
                                           web-browser. Using Lince we can
                                           quickly and easily obtain insights
                                           on hybrid systems based on a precise
                                           and formal semantics. This talk
                                           describes recent improvements to
                                           Lince and directions of future work.
                                           These improvements were driven by
                                           attempts to model concrete
                                           scenarios, which will be described
                                           in the talk, and by difficulties
                                           encountered during both the
                                           specification and the interpretation
                                           phases. More specifically, we
                                           enriched Lince with more operations,
                                           relaxed some language restrictions,
                                           improved error detection and
                                           reporting, introduced new
                                           visualisations mechanisms, and introduced a new
                                           numerical engine to complement the
                                           existing symbolic engine.

                                                        state may change in reaction to events.  Numerous methods and notations             
                                                        for specifying such reactive systems have been designed, though with                
                                                        varying focus on the different development steps and their refinement               
                                                        relations.  We first briefly review some of such methods, like                      
                                                        temporal/modal logic, TLA, Alloy, UML state machines, symbolic                      
                                                        transition systems, CSP, synchronous languages, and Event-B with their              
                                                        support for parallel composition and refinement.  We then present                   
                                                        E↓-logic for covering a broad range of abstraction levels of                        
                                                        event/data-based systems from abstract requirements to constructive                 
                                                        specifications in a uniform foundation.  E↓-logic uses diamond and box              
                                                        modalities over structured events adopted from dynamic logic, for                   
                                                        recursive process specifications it offers (control) state variables and            
                                                        binders from hybrid logic.  The semantic interpretation relies on                   
                                                        event/data transition systems; specification refinement is defined by               
                                                        model class inclusion. Constructive operational specifications given by             
                                                        state transition graphs can be characterised by a single E↓-sentence.               
                                                        Also a variety of implementation constructors is available in E↓-logic              
                                                        to support, among others, event refinement and parallel composition.                
                                                        Thus the whole development process can rely on E↓-logic and its                     
                                                        semantics as a common basis.
